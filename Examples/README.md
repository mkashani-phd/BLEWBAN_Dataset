# EXAMPLES
In this folder we are exploring the IQ package and demonstrate some classification examples using Deep Learning.

## BLEWBAN tutorial
The Analysis.ipynb has a thorough explanation of the BLEWBAN and the powerfull IQ package that is in this repository. You can find this code under [BLEWBAN_Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MDBT2rkZK7mvF0-5CpkBp85WYFNymxvO?usp=drive_link) on Google colab where you can run the command online.

# IQ package
IQ package is one of the best way to get started on this dataset. It is a powerful tool to do basic processing on the RAW IQ samples with a very user friendly interface. for more detail please check the analysis.ipynb

To start with the IQ package you first import the module form the src directory
Remember you might not need to add the path to sys.path
``` python
# Optional 
import sys
sys.path.append("..")  # Adds the parent directory to the sys.path

import src.IQ as IQ
```

Now you have to create
